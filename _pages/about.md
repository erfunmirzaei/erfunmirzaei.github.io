Hi, I am Erfan Mirzaei. 

I am a third-year [ELLIS](https://ellis.eu/) Ph.D. student in Applied Mathematics and Machine Learning at Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia & École Polytechnique & Università di Genova, where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Massimiliano Pontil](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lcOacs8AAAAJ) and Prof. [Karim Lounici](https://klounici.github.io/).

My overarching goal is to explain **why and how modern machine learning algorithms generalize**. To bridge the gap between empirical success and statistical theory, I leverage advanced probability tools, specifically:
* **Concentration Inequalities** (especially for dependent data and stochastic processes)
* **The PAC-Bayesian Framework**
* **Information Theory**

Currently, I am investigating the generalization properties of stochastic dynamical systems—such as Gibbs and Langevin Monte Carlo algorithms—particularly within the interpolation regime. I am deeply interested in establishing rigorous, data-dependent theoretical bounds that hold up in complex, realistic settings.
