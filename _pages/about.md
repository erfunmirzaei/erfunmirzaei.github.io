Hi, I am Erfan Mirzaei. 

I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Applied Mathematics and Machine Learning, proudly part of the [ELLIS](https://ellis.eu/) (European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems) network. My research is jointly conducted at the **Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (CSML Lab)**, the **University of Genoa**, and **École Polytechnique**, where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Massimiliano Pontil](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lcOacs8AAAAJ) and Prof. [Karim Lounici](https://klounici.github.io/).

### Research

My overarching goal is to explain **why and how modern machine learning algorithms generalize**. To bridge the gap between empirical success and statistical theory, I leverage advanced probability tools, specifically:
* **Concentration Inequalities** (especially for dependent data and stochastic processes)
* **The PAC-Bayesian Framework**
* **Information Theory**

Currently, I am investigating the generalization properties of stochastic dynamical systems—such as Gibbs and Langevin Monte Carlo algorithms—particularly within the interpolation regime. I am deeply interested in establishing rigorous, data-dependent theoretical bounds that hold up in complex, realistic settings.

### Background

Before moving to Europe, I completed my M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics at the **University of Tehran** (graduating 2nd in my cohort), where I developed social learning algorithms for bandit problems using Free Energy principles. I also hold a B.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Tehran, where I first transitioned into AI by applying reinforcement learning to smart environments.
